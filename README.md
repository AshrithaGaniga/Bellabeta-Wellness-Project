## Project Overview
This project is part of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone** and focuses on analyzing smart device usage data to gain insights into consumer behavior. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy. The dataset used is the **FitBit Fitness Tracker Dataset**.

## Business Task
Bellabeat, a health-focused company, wants to understand how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices to track their fitness and wellness. The objective is to analyze fitness trends, activity levels, and sleep patterns to make data-driven recommendations that enhance Bellabeat’s product offerings and marketing strategies.

## How This Project Solves the Business Task
- Conducted a detailed analysis of user activity, sleep, and calorie burn trends using SQL and MySQL Workbench.
- Created an interactive **Tableau dashboard** that allows stakeholders to explore fitness behavior trends visually.
- Provided **key insights** on activity levels, sedentary behavior, and sleep patterns, helping Bellabeat refine its product features.
- Identified potential user groups who may benefit from Bellabeat’s wellness devices and features, aiding in targeted marketing strategies.

## Tools Used
- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)**: Data cleaning and analysis
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboard creation
- **Excel**: Used only for formatting data according to MySQL Workbench requirements

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains multiple CSV files tracking users' daily activities, sleep, calories burned, and other fitness metrics. Key files used:
- `dailyActivity.csv`
- `sleepDay.csv`
- `weightLogInfo.csv`

## Dashboard Features
The interactive **Bellabeat Wellness Dashboard** includes:

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
- Displays essential metrics such as **Total Steps**, **Total Calories Burned**, and **Total Active Minutes**.
- Helps stakeholders quickly assess users' overall activity levels and engagement with fitness tracking.

### **Line Chart: Calories vs. Steps Trend**
- Visualizes the relationship between calories burned and steps taken over time.
- Enables analysis of whether increased physical activity directly leads to higher calorie expenditure.

### **Bar Chart: Activity Breakdown**
- Categorizes users' daily activities into **Sedentary, Light, Moderate, and Intense** activity levels.
- Highlights the proportion of time spent in each category, revealing behavioral trends.

### **Pie Chart: Sleep Distribution**
- Illustrates the proportion of users falling into different sleep duration ranges (e.g., <5 hours, 5-7 hours, 7+ hours).
- Helps identify common sleep patterns and potential areas for wellness improvement.

### **Interactive Filters: User ID & Date**
- Allows users to explore personalized insights by selecting specific users or date ranges.
- Enhances dashboard usability by enabling targeted analysis of trends and behaviors over time.

## Key Insights
- Users with higher step counts tend to burn more calories.
- Most users spend a significant portion of their day in sedentary activity.
- Sleep patterns vary, with some users not meeting recommended sleep durations.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate additional fitness metrics for deeper insights.
- Automate data updates using Python or SQL scripts.
- Expand the dashboard with more user engagement statistics.
